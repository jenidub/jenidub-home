# Replit Prompt for JeniDub Homepage

I need help building a professional brand website homepage for JeniDub. I have the complete HTML structure and content ready, and I'd like you to reference the design style from the attached Podia screenshot.

## Brand Overview
**JeniDub** is a tech education brand teaching professionals to "Think Like a Programmer, No Code Required." The brand focuses on making programmer thinking accessible to non-technical professionals navigating AI adoption.

**Brand Identity:**
- **Colors:** Pacific Teal (#008B8B), Warm Coral (#FF6B6B), Sage Green (#9CAF88)
- **Voice:** "Cali Chill" - patient, approachable, professional but not stuffy
- **Target Audience:** Professionals ages 25-45 working with AI, career changers, non-technical team members

## Current HTML File
I have a complete HTML file with all content and styling (attached separately). Please use this as the foundation, but incorporate design elements from the attached Podia screenshot.

## Content Sections (In Order)
1. **Hero Section** - Gradient background with headline, series description, launch announcement, and YouTube subscribe CTA
2. **Mini Bio Section** - Photo placeholder + bio text with link to About page
3. **Three Skills Section** - Three cards with icons explaining Decomposition, Critical Thinking, and Effective Communication
4. **Cali Chill Philosophy** - Three cards with icons explaining the teaching approach
5. **Two-Path CTA Section** - Gradient background with two options: "Want to Learn?" and "Need Help Now?"

## Design Requirements

**From Podia Reference (see attached screenshot):**
- Clean, modern layout with good whitespace
- Professional card designs with subtle shadows
- Smooth section transitions
- Mobile-responsive grid layouts
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Professional typography

**Brand-Specific:**
- Use brand colors: Pacific Teal, Warm Coral, Sage Green
- Alternating section backgrounds (white/light gray)
- Gradient backgrounds on Hero and CTA sections
- Card hover effects (subtle lift)
- Rounded corners on buttons and cards
- Professional but approachable aesthetic

## Specific Elements to Match from Podia
(Reference attached screenshot)
- Card styling and spacing
- Button design and hover states
- Section padding and rhythm
- Typography hierarchy
- Overall professional polish

## What I Need
Please create a production-ready homepage that:
1. Uses my existing HTML content structure
2. Incorporates the design aesthetic from the Podia screenshot
3. Maintains my brand colors and identity
4. Is fully responsive and polished
5. Includes smooth interactions and professional finish

The final result should feel like a professional course creator's website (like Podia) but with JeniDub's unique brand personality.
